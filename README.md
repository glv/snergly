# Snergly

The maze algorithms from Jamis Buck's [Mazes for Programmers][mazes],
implemented in Clojure.

I'm doing this as a fun project to improve my Clojure skills.

## Plans

I'd like to work through all of the maze algorithms themselves;
I already see enough of the same kind of complexity to deal with that
I think this will help me with some of the struggles I'm having with
[Cló][clo].

But I'd also like to go farther.  In the book, Buck renders the mazes
using a PNG-generation library, but I think there would be value in
building dynamic displays that show the maze generation algorithms in
action, animating the flow of the algorithms as they process mazes.
That kind of display would be a nice excuse for me to play with 
ClojureScript and perhaps Om.

;; This seems like a perfect application for property-based testing.  There's
;; no way to inspect a maze and prove that it was generated by a correct
;; implementation of, say, Wilson's algorithm.  And the inherent randomness of
;; the algorithms means that any particular example I come up with might not
;; expose all of the issues.
;;
;; But we do know that all of these algorithms are supposed to produce
;; "perfect" mazes (fully connected, no loops).  And I know that I want them
;; all to report intermediate results for animation purposes according to
;; particular rules.
;;
;; So if I can find a way to validate that the final maze is a perfect maze,
;; then I can have a fair degree of confidence that an implementation that
;; seems (from inspection) to correctly implement the algorithm is, in fact,
;; correct, because nearly all bugs would either disrupt that property or cause
;; a crash or non-termination.  (A bug that didn't do any of those things would
;; actually mean it was a different algorithm.)
;;
;; And if I can find a way to validate that the intermediate results are
;; reported according to my rules, then I can be confident that the animations
;; are correct.

;; What kinds of properties can I assert about the maze algorithms?
;;
;; * The final grid is a perfect maze: each cell can reach every other cell
;;   by exactly one path
;;   * Each cell is linked to at least one other (done)
;;   * Each cell is visited by find-distances (done)
;;   * The graph contains no cycles (done)
;; * At each step, the cells marked changed are the only ones that have changed
;;   * implemented, but either not working right or they all fail.  But it's
;;     super-complicated, amd might not be worth the trouble.
;;   * perhaps a simpler version?  All of the current maze algorithms advance
;;     a cell at a time. So perhaps just verify that each update changes two
;;     cells, and those cells must be linked to each other.  That seems like a
;;     much simpler proxy for what we want.
;;     * this is partially done, but h-a-k and r-b fail because of the one
;;       below.
;; * Each reported grid is changed?
;;   * done, but h-a-k and r-b fail it (in an innocuous way: the last grid is
;;     reported twice).
;; * (maybe) if no intermediate-chan, the result grid shows all cells changed

;; What kinds of properties can I assert about find-distances?
;;
;; * Each cell is changed exactly once
;; * :max is monotonically increasing (starting with 1)
;; * Each step, every changed cell has distance :max
;; * (maybe) if no intermediate-chan, the result grid shows all cells changed
